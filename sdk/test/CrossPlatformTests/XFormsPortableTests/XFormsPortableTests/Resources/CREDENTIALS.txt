To provide credentials to your Android app, place credentials.json file into this directory with the below format, with your own credentials. Specifying SessionToken is optional: if you are not using session credentials, SessionToken key/value can be removed.
This file will be ignored by git and SHOULD NOT be added to your repo.

{
    "AccessKeyId" : "ACCESSKEY",
    "SecretAccessKey" : "SECRETKEY",
    "SessionToken"    : ""
}
